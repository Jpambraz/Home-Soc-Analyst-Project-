# Home-Soc-Analyst-Project-
-A simple setup to make a Security Operation Center, Using Both Ubuntu and win11


Objectives With this project: Make a lab where one machine is an attacker and the other one is the defender, using LimaCharlie to see the telemetry and creation of YARA "Yet Another Recursive Acronym" and Sigma rules, blocking C2 "Command and Control" and privilege scalation, blocking automation using *Sliver*


What i m gonna need:
-a copy of windows 
-a ubutuntu copy 

Part 1 - Put yourself in Adversary Place *Taking Notes and making observations*.

Part 2- Simulating the adversary attack to notice detections.

Part 3- Blocking A Attack. 

Part 4- Adjusting False Positives.

Part 5- Scaning with YARA through rules of detection. 


Explaining a little of LimaCharlie. 
It is a platform of SecOps based in cloud with the focus being EDX/XDR *detection and response* collecting telemetry through the analysis of logs and Security Automation, being able to manage EndPoint Security.
